I completed my Ph.D. in 2019 at the University of Trento under the supervision of [Marcello Federico](https://sites.google.com/site/marcellofedericohome/). In my doctoral research, which I conducted with a fellowship from Fondazione Bruno Kessler, I studied unsupervised learning of morphology, from the aspects of linguistics, cognitive science and statistics, and designed a purely statistical formulation of it within the Bayesian framework, which could be implemented in decoders of neural machine translation models in order to generate better translations in morphologically-rich languages. During my Ph.D. I also did a research visit to the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh to work with [Dr. Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) where I contributed to the [SUMMA](http://summa-project.eu/) project. Prior to joining the New York University, I conducted my post-doctoral research and studies at the [Institute of Computational Linguistics, University of Zürich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/ataman.html) where I contributed to the [MUTAMUR](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/texttechnologies/research/machine-learning/mutamur.html) project.
