I completed my Ph.D. in 2019 at the University of Trento under the supervision of [Marcello Federico](https://sites.google.com/site/marcellofedericohome/). In my doctoral research, which I conducted with the fellowship from Fondazione Bruno Kessler, I studied unsupervised learning of morphology, including the aspects of linguistics, cognitive science and statistics, and designed a purely statistical formulation of it within the Bayesian framework, which could be implemented in generative models to help produce better sentences in morphologically-rich languages. I also had a research visit at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in order to work with [Dr. Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) where I contributed to the [SUMMA](http://summa-project.eu/) project. Since I finished my Ph.D. I have started studying syntax in order to design a more linguistically-expressive statistical model of morphosyntax, which I hope will help better generalization in multi-lingual models.
