I am the lecturer of the new course in the Bachelor's programme in Computational Linguistics and Language Technology on the creation and annotation of linguistic resources. This course aims to present a practical introduction to corpus linguistics, building manual and automatic annotation tools and statistical analysis of corpora with programming exercises.

The course will continue in Spring 2021.
